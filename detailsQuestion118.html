            Symptoms that do not appear in the left / right half Symptoms that do not appear in the upper/lower half Method of action Check other channel change Symptoms with only half of the screen may occur due to a broadcast signal abnormality or a product abnormality. In this case, it is necessary to change the channel you are watching to another broadcast channel to check if it occurs the same. If it is displayed as normal when changing other channels, it is necessary to check the broadcast signal. If you use a set-top box, it may occur due to more than a set-top box or a connected cable.

In this case, please contact the broadcaster to check the broadcast signal [wired, cable, skylife, IPTV, etc.]. Check One Connect Cable This may occur if the One Connect cable is not connected normally, In this case, please disconnect and reconnect the One Connect cable.
