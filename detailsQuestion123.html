            [Remocon's] Home button Press] [Lower left] Set  Move] [Menu → Customer support Move] [ Self-diagnosis Select] [Sample image stored on TV is displayed] [If there are no symptoms of the problem, select No] [Select to close image quality test completion] <br /> ※ Sample images are played on the screen during image quality tests, and if the image is clearly visible, image quality abnormalities may occur due to abnormalities in external broadcast signals, not product abnormalities. In this case, you should contact the cable broadcaster you are watching for a signal check.  If the sample image is not clear during the image quality test, it may occur due to internal symptoms of LCD panel or TV.  Please get an accurate diagnosis from a professional engineer for that part.
