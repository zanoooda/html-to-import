            Method of action Broadcast signal check Symptoms of a round light leaking on the screen only on a specific broadcast channel can be caused by a broadcast signal abnormality, not a product abnormality. If there is an abnormality in the liquid crystal or mainboard of the product, it occurs equally on all channels, but if it occurs on a specific channel, please contact the broadcaster (wired, cable, skylife, etc.) you are watching to check the signal. Self-diagnosis confirmation method - It is possible to simply diagnose the abnormality of the product using the self-diagnosis function that can check the abnormality of the TV product. ■ Setting method - Press the home button of the remote control → Settings → Menu → Customer Support → Self Diagnosis → Screen test [Click remote control home button] [Move left lower setting] [Menu → Move Customer Support] [Self-diagnosis Selection] [Select to start screen test] [Sample image stored on TV is displayed] [If there are no symptoms of the problem, select No] [Select to close image quality test completion] When the image quality is tested, the sample image is played on the screen, and the image is clearly visible Image quality abnormalities may occur due to abnormalities in external broadcast signals, not product abnormalities. In this case, you should contact the cable broadcaster you are watching for a signal check. If the sample image is not clear during the image quality test There is a possibility that it may occur due to internal symptoms of LCD panel or TV. Please get an accurate diagnosis from a professional engineer for that part.
