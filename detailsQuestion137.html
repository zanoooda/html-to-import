            The TV stand looks tilted.<br /> 1.The stand is assembled separately, not integral with the TV, so there is a slight tolerance between the TV and the stand connection.<br /> 2. Due to this tolerance, even if normal installation is carried out, symptoms that appear to be tilted to one side occur, The larger the inch, the more severe the slanting symptoms may appear.<br /> 3. In this case, there is nothing wrong with the product. The decoration may not be leveled and may cause symptoms that appear to be tilted.<br /> 4. Please adjust the level according to how to use the cabinet.<br /> 5. In addition, optical illusions may occur depending on the wallpaper or art wall pattern around the TV and may look tilted. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
