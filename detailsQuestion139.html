            I logged in to the menu ON TV automatically and looked at it, and it doesn't work even though it's supposed to be turned off. Answers  When the UN55F6900AF model is powered on, the symptom that the Naver window appears is that the ticker function is set to Naver You can use the ticker auto-run function after setting it to "off" as below.  ☞ You can select the virtual remote control (virtual remote control image) → menu (menu button image) → smart function → app setting → automatic ticker execution → off of the smart touch remote control.
