            Please tell me how to output sound to the TV speaker when playing videos on the PC. Answers If you connect a PC product with a DVI to HDMI cable and watch a video played on the PC on the TV screen, the TV model you are using does not support the PC voice input terminal You can't hear the sound output from the PC through the TV speaker, and you have to connect the speaker for the PC. For reference, if the PC product you are using has an HDMI output port, you can hear the sound output from the PC through the TV speaker by connecting with the HDMI to HDMI cable.
