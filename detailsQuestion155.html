            I set it because I needed to make an automatic on reservation, but it turns on automatically but there is no broadcast. Currently, the external input signal is a component, and please check if it is possible to make the auto-on broadcast come out. Answers  The automatic on setting function of UN50J5000AF product is selected from DTV general, DTV wired, general, wired, and USB, so that part must be selected.  However, when IPTV and set-top box are connected to TV, the screen does not appear because it is not recognized as an external input even if it is scheduled to be turned on.  If you use it as an external input, the auto-on setting is not supported because you cannot select the external input itself.
