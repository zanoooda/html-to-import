            The digital hub can create a list of all connected devices and shows everything at once on a large screen.    Home appliances have various connection methods such as Bluetooth/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)/Wi-Fi. The digital hub connects supported devices regardless of the connection method, so there is no need for a separate distinction. In addition, IR remote control devices that are not connected to the Internet can be connected to IR signals on TVs through digital hubs.  Devices that require registration can be easily detected and connected through alarms. In addition, other devices (SmartThings devices, Set-top boxes, etc.) already registered on Samsung Smart TV can be controlled as digital hubs without separate registration.   - Features and user interfaces may vary depending on the model and region. - This feature may not be supported when purchasing a product. - Digital hubs may not be supported for some products and features.
