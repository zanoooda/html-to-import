Inspection method<br /> 1.Disconnect the connection lines of all products except TV and sound bar connections.<br /> 2. Keep the distance between the sound bar and the router at least 1m.<br /> 3. When connecting the TV and the sound bar, it is normal, but if it occurs by connecting additional external devices such as set-tops or game consoles, please check the device.
