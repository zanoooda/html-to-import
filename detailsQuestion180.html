            <br /> ※ In the case of digital broadcasting, there are cases where the camera being filmed looks like a defective pixel through the TV due to foreign matter or dust, or when shooting in a dark place, several bright spots of light may shine. At this time, if there are no symptoms when switching to another channel and watching another broadcast, it can be seen as a problem according to the broadcaster's shooting signal. Checks are required if the same part occurs when switching other channels or watching other broadcasts. Image quality test method<br /> 1.Click the home or menu of the TV remote control to set → Customer support → Device care → Self-diagnosis → Image quality test.<br /> 2. Please select the "OK" button on the image quality test screen. The test photo will be displayed soon.<br /> 3. If the test screen appears normally, select "Yes"<br /> 4. If the diagnosis result is normal, it is likely to be a signal from an external device or a cable abnormality. Please check the external device or the connection status.<br /> 5. If the image quality test screen does not appear normally, select "No". Additional test screen appears.<br /> 6. If you have the same symptoms in the additional sample image, you'd better check the TV. Defective pixel checking method<br /> 1.Symptoms that appear purple in black spots (dark spots, sunspots) or white patterns on the screen allow one defect per million, and up to six FHD TVs are normal.<br /> 2. If the point you see on the screen is a bright point (noun point, white point) and the same phenomenon occurs on all channels, you need to check it. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
