            If a vertical line (vertical line) is visible on the TV screen, there is something wrong with the TV, there is a problem with the broadcast signal, and if it occurs at the top or bottom of the screen, it is a signal characteristic of an external device.

Please select the "OK" button on the image quality test screen. The test photo will be displayed soon.<br /> 3. If the test screen appears normally, select "Yes"<br /> 4. If the diagnosis result is normal, it is likely to be a signal from an external device or a cable abnormality. Please check the external device or the connection status.<br /> 5. If the image quality test screen does not appear normally, select "No". Additional test screen appears.<br /> 6. If you have the same symptoms in the additional sample image, you'd better check the TV.

The number of channels searched may vary depending on the region, broadcaster, and surrounding environment.<br /> 3.
