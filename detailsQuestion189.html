            If the screen does not appear when using the set-top, it is highly likely that the external input switching is wrong or the cable that transmits the signal or signal of the set-top is abnormal. Image quality test method<br /> 1.Click the home or menu of the TV remote control to set → Customer support → Device care → Self-diagnosis → Image quality test.<br /> 2. Please select the "OK" button on the image quality test screen. The test photo will be displayed soon.<br /> 3. Select "Yes" when the test screen appears normally.<br /> 4. If the diagnosis result is normal, it is likely to be a signal from an external device or a cable abnormality. Please check the external device or the connection status.<br /> 5. If the image quality test screen does not appear normally, select "No". Additional test screen appears.<br /> 6. If you have the same symptoms in the additional sample image, you'd better check the TV. METHOD FOR SWITCHING FROM TV BROADCAST SCREEN TO SET-TOOP Press the home button on the TV remote control to select external input → set top (HDMI1). METHOD FOR SWITCHING FROM SETTOP BROADCAST SCREEN TO TV Press the home button on the TV remote control to enter externally → Select TV. METHOD FOR SWITCHING FROM SETTOP BROADCAST SCREEN TO GAME SCREEN Press the home button on the TV remote control to select external input → game console (HDMI4). HDMI connection terminals may vary by TV model. Check and reconnect HDMI cables when using set-top<br /> 1.I recommend you to use a genuine cable. If the authenticated HDMI cable is not used, the screen may not be visible or a connection error may occur. Please check the genuine logo. Check "Ultra High Speed HDMI" print or imprint on HDMI cable.<br /> 2. Connect the set-top box and TV to check if external input connection lines such as HDMI are connected normally when watching the broadcast. Set-top power checking method<br /> 1.If there is no set-top power light, please reconnect the power.<br /> 2. When the set-top power is on standby, use the set-top remote control to turn on the power.<br /> 3. If the power is not turned on, please contact the set-top manufacturer (communication company).
