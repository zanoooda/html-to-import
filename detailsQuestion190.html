            If a high-frequency sound or spark popping sound occurs while watching TV, noise occurs in the external input signal or a potential difference between the external devices occurs. Sound quality test method<br /> 1.Press the Home or Menu button on the TV remote control to select Settings → Customer Support → Device Care → Self Diagnosis → Sound Quality Test.<br /> 2. If the reproduced sample sound is heard neatly without noise, it is a symptom of noise due to broadcast signal problems, not product problems.<br /> 3. In this case, you should contact the broadcaster for a broadcast signal check. [wired, cable, IPTV, etc.] However, if there is noise in the reproduced sample sound, it is recommended to check the TV. Check and reconnect antenna cables<br /> 1.If you are watching TV with an antenna, please completely separate and reconnect the antenna connection line between the TV and the wall terminal. Check and reconnect HDMI cable when using set-top<br /> 1.I recommend you to use a genuine cable. If the authenticated HDMI cable is not used, the screen may not be visible or a connection error may occur.<br /> 2. Connect the set-top box and TV to check if external input connection lines such as HDMI are connected normally when watching the broadcast. Connect TV and external device to same outlet<br /> 1.Please connect the power outlet of the TV and the external device to the same outlet. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
