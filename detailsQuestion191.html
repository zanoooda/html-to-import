            If the entire TV screen is blurred and numerous points occur, the broadcast signal is defective or the analog channel is in use. Other screens come out clearly, but if numerous points occur, it is likely to be an external device or HDMI cable characteristic. Broadcasting signal test method<br /> 1.Press the Home or Menu button on the TV remote control to select Settings → Customer Support → Device Care → Self Diagnosis → Signal Information.<br /> 2. If the antenna signal is 4 or less or the SNR value is 20 or less, it is recommended to check the broadcast signal. Signal information is only available on digital broadcast channels. Check and reconnect antenna cables<br /> 1.If you are watching TV with an antenna, please completely separate and reconnect the antenna connection line between the TV and the wall terminal. Automatic channel setting method<br /> 1.Click Home or Menu on the TV remote control to select Settings → Channel / Broadcasting → Automatic Channel Settings.<br /> 2. The number of channels searched may vary depending on the region, broadcaster, and surrounding environment. If the channel or automatic channel setting is disabled, we are currently using an external device (set-top box), so please change the external input to 'TV broadcasting'. Check and reconnect HDMI cable when using set-top<br /> 1.I recommend you to use a genuine cable. If the authenticated HDMI cable is not used, the screen may not be visible or a connection error may occur.<br /> 2. Connect the set-top box and TV to check if external input connection lines such as HDMI are connected normally when watching the broadcast. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
