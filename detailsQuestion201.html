           <br /> 1.The sound bar HDMI ARC is not recognized, the sound bar BT (Bluetooth) is cut off.<br /> 2. Due to the influence of external devices, the connection between the TV and the sound bar may not be smooth.<br /> 3. Inspection method<br /> 4. Disconnect the connection lines of all products except TV and sound bar connections.<br /> 5. Keep the distance between the sound bar and the router at least 1 m (meter).<br /> 6. When connecting the TV and the sound bar, it is normal, but if it occurs by connecting additional external devices such as set-tops or game consoles, please check the device. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video. <br /> ※ ARC function is to input or output sound only by connecting HDMI cable from sound bar that supports ARC TV voice. □ Input conditions that support ARC - TV can be output only for digital voice among input conditions through tuner. - In HDMI version 1.4 or higher, products that support ARC function are compatible with each other. (i.e., the TV supports HDMI 2 (ARC) but will not be able to use it unless it supports peripheral ARC. ) - If both products support ARC function in 1.4 version, sound bar voice is output when selecting TV simple menu → receiver listening. Please try the following method to take action against symptoms. - If the sound bar HDMI ARC is not recognized, you can change the HDMI cable to check the recognition status. - If the sound bar Bluetooth is cut off, it may be a symptom due to the surrounding environment. If the wireless router (2.4GHz/5GHz) is nearby, symptoms may occur due to overlapping signals, so please try Bluetooth connection again by raising the distance from the router. If the above method is not solved, it may occur due to sound bar HDMI connection terminal or built-in Bluetooth symptoms. Please get an accurate diagnosis from a professional engineer for that part.
