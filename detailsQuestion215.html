            ■ Model name search guide You can put the model name directly in Korea. (Korea does not need to select a manufacturer, only other countries are needed) <br /> ※ When there is no actual exact model number, it works even if you put a similar model number. E.g.) If the model is SMT-5100 and SMT 5000 is in the list, you can select even if you have SMT4000 if there is no selection The search method can be judged as support if it is possible to check the model information when searching for the model name (instead, you must enter the exact model name to search) If you don't have an accurate model, you should search for a similar model. Model name search method Direct search for model number Click Search Product Model Number Model name checking method<br /> 1.Set-top box front (manufacturer)<br /> 2. Back or bottom of set-top box (check model name)<br /> 3. Direct search for model number<br /> 4. Keyboard input selection Tip.
