           <br /> 1.High-frequency noise while watching TV. I'm watching TV and it's making a lot of noise.<br /> 2. If a high-frequency sound or spark popping sound occurs while watching TV, noise occurs in the external input signal or a potential difference occurs between external devices.<br /> 3. Acoustic test method<br /> 4. Click Home or Menu on the TV remote control to set → Customer support → Self-diagnosis → Start sound test.<br /> 5. If the reproduced sample sound is heard neatly without noise, it is a symptom of noise due to broadcasting signal problems, not product problems.<br /> 6. In this case, you should contact the broadcaster for a broadcast signal check. (wired, cable, skylife, IPTV, etc.)<br /> 7. However, if noise occurs in the played sample sound, it is recommended to check the TV.<br /> 8. Check and reconnect antenna cables<br /> 9. Please completely separate and reconnect the antenna connection line between the TV and the wall terminal.<br /> 10. Please make sure to connect the antenna cable even if you are not using it. (To be adjacent)<br /> 11. Check and reconnect HDMI cables when using set-top 12. I recommend you to use a genuine cable. If the authenticated HDMI cable is not used, the screen may not be visible or a connection error may occur. 13. Connect the set-top box and TV to check if external input connection lines such as HDMI are connected normally when watching the broadcast. 14. Connect TV and external device to same outlet 15. Connect the power outlet of the TV and external device to the same outlet. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
