           Is it possible to connect the Bluetooth headset to the UN50F6900AF TV model and output voice only with the headset?<br /> 2. And can I connect earphones or headsets to the rear terminal by wire? It's called audio minijack, but doesn't regular stereojack have an output terminal? Answers Hello. Sir/ma'am. I am the person in charge of Samsung Electronics service cyber center. Please understand that the UN50F6900AF model you inquired about does not support Bluetooth headsets and cannot be connected to wireless headsets. The UN50F6900AF model does not support earphone terminals (stereo jacks) and only has voice output terminals. The voice output terminal is a terminal that only outputs the sound from the TV as it is, and when the earphone is connected, the sound is output to the TV and also to the earphone. The voice output terminal cannot adjust the volume, and in the case of the earphone jack terminal, is the sound muted so that the sound cannot be output to the TV speaker? , the voice output terminal is not muted, so audio output is performed together with the TV and the earphone connected to the voice output terminal. In other words, if the volume of the TV is reduced after connecting the earphone to the voice output terminal, the TV speaker does not make a sound, and the earphone terminal outputs audio, but the size of the output audio volume cannot be adjusted. Please understand that the UN50F6900AF model does not have a Bluetooth headset and earphone terminal. Thank you.
