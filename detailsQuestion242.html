            It is not equipped with a wireless LAN, so I am using a Samsung genuine wireless LAN plugged into USB. Not long ago, there was a Geumyoung karaoke app on the smart hub, so it was beneficial and good to run it, so I bought a USB microphone (KSM-508) through Geumyoung Shopping Mall, plugged it into USB, and used it, and it came out about 0.5 seconds late when the microphone voice was output to the speaker. There are a total of 3 USB terminals on the TV, and it's the same even if you plug them in. As a result of the inquiry to Geumyoung, I exchanged it for the same other product, but it's the same. Geumyoung says there is no problem because they test and go out. If the same symptoms appear with the new product, it may be a TV problem, so please contact the manufacturer. The microphone standard is frequency response: 60hz to 15khz impedance: 600 omega+-3 at 1khz. I don't know if it's professional, but please let me know if the speed of outputting the microphone as sound after responding to the TV is slow or the microphone itself is a problem. Answers In the case of USB microphones, voice delay inevitably occurs in the process of converting digital signals into analog signals, and Geumyoung Mimi Noraebang uses AUX to enter the outside input of TV, so there is no symptom of delayed voice. Please note that it is a characteristic part of the Geumyoung karaoke device. Among the products of Geumyoung Noraebang, you need to use Geumyoung Mini Emp, an external device. It's a pity that you're using a USB microphone, but it's hard to improve. Please understand that it is a hardware SPEC.
