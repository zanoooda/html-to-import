           <h1 class="listQuestionTitle">Question content The smart TV model is UN48H5800, and a few days ago, NFSMW*14 download was possible from the smart hub game, but this APPS disappeared from the 22nd, what happened? Does the APPS downloadability vary depending on the model? Is it impossible to download applications such as car racing game NFSMW*14 and NEED FOR SPEED MOST? ? Answers Due to differences depending on the product model, NEED FOR SPEED is not downloaded and supported for UN48H5800 products</h1>

       <li class="subAnswerP">
            Please understand that it is difficult to download and use the game due to lack of RAM for the model to run NEED FOR SPEED. For reference, the game X14 can only be played in models over 6400, which is a 1.25GB RAM model. .
