            Answers When the TV is powered on, the phenomenon that runs from the smart hub screen as shown in the figure below is when the ON TV auto-start is set to "on" and when the function is set to "off", You can watch it on the TV screen right away. The setting method is to set the remote control of the TV product Set virtual remote control → menu → smart function → ON TV → auto start to "off" You can do it.
