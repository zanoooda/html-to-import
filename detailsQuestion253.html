           0 to UN46ES6800, it will not be recognized.  It is said that it is a device that cannot be known if it is recognized.  Don't you have software upgrades or something like that? Answers The USB port of the TV product does not support USB<br /> 3.0 and can only be supported up to USB<br /> 2.0. Also, regarding USB<br /> 3.0 compatibility, it is not recognized through software upgrade as a hardware part, not software.
