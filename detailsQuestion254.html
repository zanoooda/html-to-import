            Answers The Bluetooth function of the TV product is a function to use 3D glasses or remote control, and the Bluetooth speaker (headset, earphone) cannot be connected and used. However, if the audio cable included in the E0-SB330 Bluetooth speaker is connected to the voice output terminal of the TV product and the audio input terminal of the Bluetooth speaker, the TV broadcast sound can be heard through the speaker.  For reference, if you want to hear sound only with a Bluetooth speaker, you can select an external speaker from menu → sound → speaker setting → TV sound output.  In addition, you can set it as a TV speaker to listen to both TV speakers and external speakers.  <br /> ※ If you set it to an external speaker, the volume button and silent mode are not available, and there are restrictions on use among sound menus.
