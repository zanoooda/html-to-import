            Even when I turn off the TV, it makes “tuk” and “tuk” noises.<br /> 1.The main appliances that make up the finished TV can cause certain noises depending on the temperature characteristics.<br /> 2. It contracts / expands according to internal temperature changes while watching TV, and it is a sound that occurs instantaneously at the screw fastening part of the front / rear case assembly part.<br /> 3. It is not a product failure problem, but a sound caused by temperature change, so it is not more than a product. Don't worry and use it.<br /> 4. If pop noise occurs more than 10 times a day on a regular basis, you should check it out. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
