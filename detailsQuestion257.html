            Let's find out how to deal with symptoms of increased and decreased voice while watching TV. <br /> ※ While watching TV, it got bigger and smaller on the same channel If repeated, it is likely to be more than a broadcast signal or a characteristic of broadcaster equipment. Broadcasting signal test method<br /> 1.Click Home or Menu on the TV remote control to select “Settings,” “Customer Support,” and “Start Signal Information.”<br /> 2. If the antenna signal is 4 or less or the SNR value is 20 or less, it is recommended to check the broadcast signal.<br /> 3. Signaling information is only available on digital broadcast channels. Automatic volume control method<br /> 1.There may be a difference in voice level depending on the broadcast program produced by the broadcasting station, and when the channel is changed, the voice may be small or the voice may be large.<br /> 2. It mainly occurs on wired broadcasting channels rather than regular broadcasting channels, and the automatic volume function is applied on TV to compensate for the different volume of each panel.<br /> 3. When you set the automatic volume function, the volume decreases, but you can watch all channels at a similar volume.<br /> 4. Click Home or Menu on the TV remote control to select and turn on the automatic volume in “Settings,” “Sound,” and “Expert Settings.” Software update<br /> 1.Click Home or Menu on the TV remote control to select Update now in “Settings,” “Customer Support,” and “Software Update.”<br /> 2. Do not turn off the TV during the update.<br /> 3. When the update is complete, the TV turns off and on automatically.<br /> 4. At this time, both screen and sound settings can be initialized, so it is recommended to take notes of the settings in advance.<br /> 5. Please proceed with the update when you find the latest version. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
