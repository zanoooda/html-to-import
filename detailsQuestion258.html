We are planning to expand it step by step, but so far, we have limited support near Suwon. If you guide the area, you can apply in Gangnam, Gangbuk (Jung-gu), Siheung, Yangcheon, Gwangmyeong, Bucheon, and Goyang (excluding Ilsan). Please also check whether DTV is available in the residential area. [Guide to verifiable sites] - Information yard / digital broadcasting reception confirmation ( http://211.43.210.46:8080/DigitalTV/main.jsp ) - DTV Korea / DTV Reception Environment Guide ( http://www.dtvkorea.org/ ) ■ Antenna installation guide The essential condition for watching multi-channel (MMS) broadcasting is that only households with antennas that can directly receive broadcast signals, not cable broadcasting, are available. Please check the broadcasting reception conditions you use for your generation and install an antenna that can be received directly. Antennas can be purchased at Living Plaza and Digital Plaza. The antennas on sale are MX-DTVE001 and Hemi-Beam. Please visit the nearest store.
