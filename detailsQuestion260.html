            I can't see the screen when I use the set-top box. (Settop, game console) <br /> ※ If the screen blinks or looks broken when using the set-top, it is highly likely to be an abnormality of the cable that transmits the signal or signal of the set-top. Screen test method<br /> 1.Click Home or Menu on the TV remote control to select “Settings,” “Customer Support,” “Self Diagnosis,” and “Start Screen Test.”<br /> 2. Please “check” the image quality test notification message. Sample images for testing are displayed.<br /> 3. “Do you still see the symptoms of the problem in the test video? The message ” appears.<br /> 4. If the image quality test screen is normal, select “No”.<br /> 5. Please check the broadcast signal rather than the TV problem.<br /> 6.. If you have the same symptoms in the additional sample image, you'd better check the TV. Set-top input switching method<br /> 1.Press the home or menu button of the TV remote control to select the input you want to switch from the external input. Check and reconnect the HDMI cable when using the set-top<br /> 1.On the TV remote control, click Home or Menu to select “Settings,” “Channel/Broadcast,” and “Auto Channel Settings.”<br /> 2. The number of channels searched may vary depending on the region, broadcaster, and surrounding environment.<br /> 3. If the channel or automatic channel setting is disabled, it is an external device, not a public wave signal, so contact the set-top and carrier to receive guidance on automatic channel setting. Check and reconnect HDMI cables when using set-top<br /> 1.We recommend using genuine cables. If the authenticated HDMI cable is not used, the screen may not be visible or a connection error may occur.<br /> 2. Please check the genuine logo. Check the print or imprint of “Ultra High Speed HDMI” on the HDMI cable.<br /> 3. Connect the set-top box and the TV to check if the external input connection lines such as HDMI are normally connected when watching the broadcast. Set-top power checking method<br /> 1.If there is no set-top power light, please reconnect the power.<br /> 2. When the set-top power is on standby, use the set-top remote control to turn on the power.<br /> 3. If the power is not turned on, please contact the set-top manufacturer. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
