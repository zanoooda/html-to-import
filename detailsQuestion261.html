            Let's find out how to deal with the symptoms of blinking the entire TV screen. <br /> ※ If the entire TV screen blinks, it is likely to be an abnormality in the broadcast signal or external device signal or an abnormality in the cable that transmits the signal. Broadcasting signal test method.<br /> 1.Click Home or Menu on the TV remote control to select “Settings,” “Customer Support,” and “Start Signal Information.”<br /> 2. If the antenna signal is 4 or less or the SNR value is 20 or less, it is recommended to check the broadcast signal.<br /> 3. Signaling information is only available on digital broadcast channels. Check and reconnect antenna cables<br /> 1.If you are watching TV with an antenna, please completely separate and reconnect the antenna connection line between the TV and the wall terminal.<br /> 2. Please reconnect One Connect and TV..<br /> 3. Please separate and assemble the AOC cable from the TV and One Connect. Automatic channel control method<br /> 1.On the TV remote control, click Home or Menu to select “Settings,” “Channel/Broadcast,” and “Auto Channel Settings.”<br /> 2. The number of channels searched may vary depending on the region, broadcaster, and surrounding environment.<br /> 3. If the channel or automatic channel setting is disabled, it is an external device, not a public wave signal, so contact the set-top and carrier to receive guidance on automatic channel setting. HDMI Cable Test Method<br /> 1.Click Home or Menu on the TV remote control to select “Settings,” “Customer Support,” “Self Diagnosis,” and “Start Signal Information.”<br /> 2. Please select “HDMI Cable Test” and “Start Test”. Depending on the condition of the cable, it may take 1 to 3 minutes, so please wait.<br /> 3. If the cable is normal, no problem is found. When diagnosing HDMI cable door zero, check the connection status and replace it with a genuine cable. Check and reconnect the HDMI cable when using the set-top<br /> 1.We recommend using genuine cables. If the authenticated HDMI cable is not used, the screen may not be visible or a connection error may occur.<br /> 2. Please check the genuine logo. Check the print or imprint of “Ultra High Speed HDMI” on the HDMI cable.<br /> 3. Connect the set-top box and TV to check if external input connection lines such as HDMI are connected normally when watching the broadcast. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
