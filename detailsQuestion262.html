            There's a lot of dots on the TV screen. <br /> ※ If the entire TV screen is blurred and numerous points occur, the broadcast signal is defective or the analog channel is in use. Other screens come out clearly, but if numerous points occur, it is likely to be an external device or HDMI cable characteristic. Broadcasting signal test method<br /> 1.Click Home or Menu on the TV remote control to select “Settings,” “Customer Support,” and “Start Signal Information.”<br /> 2. If the antenna signal is 4 or less or the SNR value is 20 or less, it is recommended to check the broadcast signal.<br /> 3. Signaling information is only available on digital broadcast channels. Check and reconnect antenna cables<br /> 1.If you are watching TV with an antenna, please completely separate and reconnect the antenna connection line between the TV and the wall terminal.<br /> 2. Please reconnect One Connect and TV.<br /> 3. Please separate and assemble the AOC cable from the TV and One Connect. Automatic channel control method<br /> 1.On the TV remote control, click Home or Menu to select “Settings,” “Channel/Broadcast,” and “Auto Channel Settings.”<br /> 2. The number of channels searched may vary depending on the region, broadcaster, and surrounding environment.<br /> 3. If the channel or automatic channel setting is disabled, it is an external device, not a public wave signal, so contact the set-top and carrier to receive guidance on automatic channel setting. Check and reconnect HDMI cables when using set-top<br /> 1.We recommend using genuine cables. If the authenticated HDMI cable is not used, the screen may not be visible or a connection error may occur.<br /> 2. Please check the genuine logo. Check the print or imprint of “Ultra High Speed HDMI” on the HDMI cable.<br /> 3. Connect the set-top box and the TV to check if the external input connection lines such as HDMI are normally connected when watching the broadcast. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
