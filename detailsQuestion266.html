            I see a horizontal line on the TV screen. <br /> ※ If you see a vertical line on the TV screen, there is something wrong with the TV, there is a problem with the broadcast signal, and if it occurs at the top and bottom of the screen, it is a signal characteristic of an external device. Please increase the size vertically so that the vertical line is not visible. Screen test method<br /> 1.Click Home or Menu on the TV remote control to select “Settings,” “Customer Support,” “Self Diagnosis,” and “Start Screen Test.”<br /> 2. Please “check” the image quality test notification message. Sample images for testing are displayed.<br /> 3. “Do you still see the symptoms of the problem in the test video? The message ” appears.<br /> 4. If the image quality test screen is normal, select “No”.<br /> 5. Please check the broadcast signal rather than the TV problem.<br /> 6. If you have the same symptoms in the sample image shown as T addition, it is recommended to check the TV. Check and reconnect antenna cables<br /> 1.If you are watching TV with an antenna, please completely separate and reconnect the antenna connection line between the TV and the wall terminal.<br /> 2. Please reconnect One Connect and TV.<br /> 3. Please separate and assemble the AOC cable from the TV and One Connect. Automatic channel control method<br /> 1.On the TV remote control, click Home or Menu to select “Settings,” “Channel/Broadcast,” and “Auto Channel Settings.”<br /> 2. The number of channels searched may vary depending on the region, broadcaster, and surrounding environment.<br /> 3. If the channel or automatic channel setting is disabled, it is an external device, not a public wave signal, so contact the set-top and carrier to receive guidance on automatic channel setting. TV screen size adjustment method<br /> 1.Click Home or Menu on the TV remote control to select “Settings,” “Screen,” “Screen Size Settings,” and “Screen Size.”<br /> 2. If the screen size is set to user adjustment, the user can zoom in and adjust the location.<br /> 3. Please increase the size horizontally so that the vertical line is not visible. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
