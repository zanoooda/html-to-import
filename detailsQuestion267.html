            Each TV channel has a different voice size. If the voice varies from channel to channel while watching TV, it is likely to be more than a broadcast signal or a characteristic of broadcaster equipment.

If the antenna signal is 4 or less or the SNR value is 20 or less, it is recommended to check the broadcast signal.<br /> 3.

Automatic channel control method<br /> 1.On the TV remote control, click Home or Menu to select “Settings,” “Channel/Broadcast,” and “Auto Channel Settings.”<br /> 2. The number of channels searched may vary depending on the region, broadcaster, and surrounding environment.<br /> 3. If the channel or automatic channel setting is disabled, it is an external device, not a public wave signal, so contact the set-top and carrier to receive guidance on automatic channel setting. Automatic volume control method<br /> 1.There may be a difference in voice level depending on the broadcast program produced by the broadcasting station, and when the channel is changed, the voice may be small or the voice may be large.<br /> 2.
