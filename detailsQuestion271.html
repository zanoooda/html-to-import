            When using the set-top box, the voice doesn't come out or it's strange. <br /> ※ If there is no voice or something strange when using the set-top, it is highly likely that it is an abnormality of the cable that transmits the signal or signal of the set-top. Acoustic test method<br /> 1.On the TV remote control, click Home or Menu to select “Settings,” “Customer Support,” “Self Diagnosis,” and “Start Sound Test.”<br /> 2. If the reproduced sample sound is heard neatly without noise, it is a symptom of noise due to broadcasting signal problems, not product problems.<br /> 3. In this case, you should contact the broadcaster for a broadcast signal check.<br /> 4. However, if there is noise in the reproduced sample sound, it is recommended to check the TV. Check and reconnect HDMI cables when using set-top<br /> 1.We recommend using genuine cables. If the authenticated HDMI cable is not used, the screen may not be visible or a connection error may occur.<br /> 2. Please check the genuine logo. Check the print or imprint of “Ultra High Speed HDMI” on the HDMI cable.<br /> 3. Connect the set-top box and TV to check if external input connection lines such as HDMI are connected normally when watching the broadcast. Set-top power checking method<br /> 1.If there is no set-top power light, please reconnect the power.<br /> 2. When the set-top power is on standby, use the set-top remote control to turn on the power.<br /> 3. If the power is not turned on, please contact the set-top manufacturer. Set-top volume control<br /> 1.Set-top volume control can be done by pressing the plus/minus button on the set-top remote control to increase or decrease the set-top volume.<br /> 2. If you adjust the volume with the TV remote control on a normal basis, set the set-top volume to medium. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
