            When using the set-top box, the power is turned off or on intermittently. <br /> ※ If the power is turned off or on intermittently when using the set-top, it is caused by an abnormal signal in the set-top. How to Check Event Logs<br /> 1.Press the Home or Menu button on the TV remote control to select “Settings,” “Customer Support,” and “Customer Support Information.”<br /> 2. The event log function will be applied from the 2019 model.<br /> 3. Please use the direction button of the remote control on the customer support information screen and pass it to the next page.<br /> 4. If there is information in the event log, the TV is operated by an external device.<br /> 5. If it coincides with the day of intermittent occurrence, please check the external device.<br /> 6. If there is no event log information at the bottom of the customer support information, it is not a malfunction caused by an external device, so please update the TV to the latest version. Anynet Setting Method<br /> 1.Press the Home or Menu button on the TV remote control to select "Anynet Plus" from "Settings", "General", and "External Device Management" and change it to OFF. Check and reconnect HDMI cables when using set-tops<br /> 1.We recommend using genuine cables. If the authenticated HDMI cable is not used, the screen may not be visible or a connection error may occur.<br /> 2. Please check the genuine logo. Check the print or imprint of “Ultra High Speed HDMI” on the HDMI cable.<br /> 3. Connect the set-top box and the TV to check if the external input connection lines such as HDMI are normally connected when watching the broadcast. Software Update<br /> 1.Click Home or Menu on the TV remote control to select Update now in “Settings,” “Customer Support,” and “Software Update.”<br /> 2. Do not turn off the TV during the update.<br /> 3. When the update is complete, the TV turns off and on automatically.<br /> 4. At this time, both screen and sound settings can be initialized, so it is recommended to take notes of the settings in advance.<br /> 5. Please proceed with the update when you find the latest version. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
