            I can't get a voice on a specific TV channel. If the voice varies from channel to channel while watching TV, it is likely to be more than a broadcast signal or a characteristic of broadcaster equipment. Broadcasting signal test method<br /> 1.Click Home or Menu on the TV remote control to select “Settings,” “Customer Support,” and “Start Signal Information.”<br /> 2. If the antenna signal is 4 or less or the SNR value is 20 or less, it is recommended to check the broadcast signal.<br /> 3. Signaling information is only available on digital broadcast channels. Check and reconnect antenna cables<br /> 1.If you are watching TV with an antenna, please completely separate and reconnect the antenna connection line between the TV and the wall terminal.<br /> 2. Please reconnect One Connect and TV.<br /> 3. Please separate and assemble the AOC cable from the TV and One Connect. Automatic channel control method<br /> 1.On the TV remote control, click Home or Menu to select “Settings,” “Channel/Broadcast,” and “Auto Channel Settings.”<br /> 2. The number of channels searched may vary depending on the region, broadcaster, and surrounding environment.<br /> 3. If the channel or automatic channel setting is disabled, it is an external device, not a public wave signal, so contact the set-top and carrier to receive guidance on automatic channel setting. Software update<br /> 1.Click Home or Menu on the TV remote control to select Update now in “Settings,” “Customer Support,” and “Software Update.”<br /> 2. Do not turn off the TV during the update.<br /> 3. When the update is complete, the TV turns off and on automatically.<br /> 4. At this time, both screen and sound settings can be initialized, so it is recommended to take notes of the settings in advance.<br /> 5. Please proceed with the update when you find the latest version. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
