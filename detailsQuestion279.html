            I see a dot on the TV screen. (Based on defective pixels)<br /> 1.In the case of digital broadcasting, the camera being filmed looks like a defective pixel on TV due to foreign matter or dust When shooting in the dark, bright light spots may shine in several places.<br /> 2. At this time, if there are no symptoms when watching other broadcasts by switching to the old channel, it can be seen as a problem according to the broadcaster's shooting signal.<br /> 3.. If the same part occurs when switching other channels or watching other broadcasts, inspection is required. Screen test method<br /> 1.Click Home or Menu on the TV remote control to select “Settings,” “Customer Support,” “Self Diagnosis,” and “Start Screen Test.”<br /> 2. Please “check” the image quality test notification message. Sample images for testing are displayed.<br /> 3. “Do you still see the symptoms of the problem in the test video? The message ” appears.<br /> 4. Select “No” when the image quality test screen appears normally.<br /> 5. Please check the broadcast signal rather than the TV problem.<br /> 6. If you have the same symptoms in the additional sample image, you'd better check the TV. Defective pixel checking method<br /> 1.Symptoms that appear purple in black dots or white patterns on the screen allow one defect per million, For FHD TVs, up to 6 are normal.<br /> 2. The point on the screen is bright, and if the same phenomenon occurs on all channels, inspection is required. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
