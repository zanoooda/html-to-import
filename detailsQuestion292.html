            Answers The UN55ES7100F model supports Wi-Fi direct function, so I will guide you on how to connect. (Please note that the Wi-Fi Direct function can play videos, photos, and music files, and content that is not a codec supported by TV may not be played.) ■ Wi-Fi Direct - Execution method: Menu → Network → WiFi Direct - You can connect your TV and wireless mobile device directly without a wireless router. It only applies to LED 5500, 6350, and PDP 550 models, and this feature is available when connecting Samsung wireless LAN adapters. This feature is possible only when the mobile device supports the Wi-Fi Direct feature. ■ Connect to mobile device with Wi-Fi direct function First, turn on the Wi-Fi Direct function of your mobile device.<br /> 1.Go to the Wi-Fi Direct screen. (Network → Wi-Fi Direct)<br /> 2. First, turn on the Wi-Fi Direct function of your mobile device. Select the Wi-Fi device you want. Push Button Configuration (PCB): Press the WPS (PBC) button on the device you want to connect within 2 minutes. All network values are set automatically and connected to the network. PIN: Enter the PIN number displayed on the Wi-Fi device. To disconnect, select the connected device, then select Disconnect. If the TV and smartphone are connected through the Wi-Fi Direct function, video, photo, and music files do not appear immediately on the TV screen. If you select the photo or video you want to send to the TV from the photo or video item of your smartphone, the items will appear on the photo. If you select the red square part of the figure below among the items, you will see the device item you want to connect to, and if you select the connected TV item, it will be sent to the TV and appear on the TV screen. The entry menu varies depending on the smartphone model and the smartphone OS version. If you select the red square part of the picture below among the shared items and select Wi-Fi Direct from the list below, the connected devices will appear and please select the TV item to check. If it doesn't come out right away as shown in the picture below, please turn it over to the next list and check if there is a Wi-Fi direct item in the next list.
