            Did you check today's news in the shape of a remote control at the bottom right of the screen? Click on the remote control for additional information. A pop-up saying ' is popping up. There is no button called additional information on the remote control, and I am watching TV well, but it is very inconvenient to watch because a pop-up pops up. I really want to disable this function. Please let me know how to disable it in the menu. Answers It is a pop-up message that appears when the additional information service starts on November 5, 2015, and please refer to the following to disable the message so that it does not appear.<br /> 1.If there is no additional information button on the TV remote control, press the smart hub button on the remote control to select the additional information item.<br /> 2. If the additional information item appears on the right screen, use the up/down direction key of the remote control to move to the “Settings” item and select the “Notification Settings” below.<br /> 3. Select the notification settings and uncheck the “Show Service Notifications” item.
