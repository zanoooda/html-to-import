            Answers UN32D6330BF is a model without Bluetooth function and cannot be used by connecting Bluetooth headset. In addition, the wireless LAN adapter (WIS09ABGN) is an adapter for using a wireless network, and Bluetooth earphones cannot be used even if the device is used. For reference, UN32D6330BF is a model without stereo / RCA cable connection terminal and cannot be used by connecting wired earphones.
