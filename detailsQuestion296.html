            , I saw on the back of the TV that there seems to be no terminal for connecting earphones. Please connect to the TV and check if Bluetooth is supported with detailed explanations such as parts and connection methods required for use. Answers The UN32J4030AFXKR model does not support voice output terminals, and external speakers cannot be connected and there is no other way to connect. Also, it does not support Bluetooth function, so Bluetooth speakers cannot be connected and used.
