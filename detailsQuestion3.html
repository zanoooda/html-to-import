            There may be a change in operation sound depending on the change in screen brightness, and it is a regular operation sound to perform functions normally, such as refrigerator compressor or FAN (fan) operation sound, washing machine water supply, dehydration operation sound, etc. It is managed by our strict standards and has nothing to do with product performance and reliability. Q2-1. When the Auto Focus function operates, it makes a “straight” sound. A: It is a normal operation sound generated in the process of automatic focus, and it is an operation sound for focus control, so you can use it with confidence.
