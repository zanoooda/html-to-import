Answers The earphone terminal is not supported in UN55F6450AF, and there is a<br /> 3.5Ã˜ voice output terminal. The voice output terminal does not adjust the volume size and does not mute. In other words, even if the volume of the TV is reduced after connecting the earphone to the voice output terminal, the volume cannot be adjusted with the earphone terminal. Additionally, Bluetooth earphones and headsets are not supported.
