            As far as I know, the UN55H6300AF model does not have Bluetooth function, and I wonder if it can be used by connecting a device called Bluetooth Transmeter. Answers The UN55H6300AF model does not support Bluetooth function. Computer products can be used after installing USB dongles even if Bluetooth does not support them, but TV products are difficult to use because they do not recognize Bluetooth USB dongles. Even if you connect a device called Bluetooth Transmeter, the TV does not recognize it, so please refer to it when using it.
