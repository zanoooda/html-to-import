           <br /> 1.If the TV broadcast screen is not in good condition or is cut off, it mainly occurs due to more than signals from antennas, boosters, and distributors in apartments and general homes.<br /> 2. If you are watching TV with an antenna, please completely separate and reconnect the antenna connection line between the TV and the wall terminal.<br /> 3. Please check the status of antenna cable pin. If the antenna pin is bent or broken, please replace the cable.<br /> 4. If you are using a distributor or booster, please separate it completely and reconnect it. Or try connecting directly to the TV.<br /> 5. If there is an external problem through self-diagnosis, contact the apartment management office or cable cable company. The broadcast signal self-diagnosis method is as follows.<br /> 6. When watching digital, you can check the broadcast signal along with the antenna picture by pressing the home or menu button of the remote control to set → customer support → self-diagnosis → signal information.<br /> 7. When checking, if the antenna signal strength is 4 spaces or less or the SNR value is 20 spaces or less, it is recommended to check the broadcast signal. “Signal Information” is a feature only available on digital broadcast channels.<br /> 8. If you select "signal history," you can check the history of automatically storing channels with weak signal strength. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
