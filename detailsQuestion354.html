           <br /> 1.Let's find out simply how to check if the cause is due to the product or the external environment caused by broadcasting signals and cables when the TV screen and screen are bad.<br /> 2. While watching TV, the screen may appear intermittently or continuously like a mosaic or a specific part may be broken. It usually appears when watching a digital channel.<br /> 3. Or there are lines on the screen or white dots that appear messy. In this case, it usually appears when watching an analog channel or a wired channel. The cause of the screen<br /> 1.If the above symptoms appear, it is a way to simply check whether the product is a TV problem or a broadcaster problem such as an external environment, that is, cable lines or cable wires.<br /> 2. First, when connected to the antenna line or set-top box on the TV, please check if external input connection lines such as HDMI are connected normally.<br /> 3. Select the Home or Menu button on the remote control.<br /> 4. Move to the left and go to the "Settings" tab to select Settings.<br /> 5. Please go down and select "Customer Support".<br /> 6. Please choose self-diagnosis.<br /> 7. Please select Start Screen Test.<br /> 8. Please 'check' the image quality test notification message.<br /> 9. Please check the video.<br /> 10. You get a message saying, "Do you still see the symptoms of the problem in the test video?" If the image quality test screen appears normally, select No. Please check the broadcast signal rather than the TV problem.<br /> 11. Select an example if it is similar to the image quality test screen. It shows two additional screens, and if this is also the same symptom, it is recommended to check the TV. 12. When watching digital, you can check the broadcast signal with the antenna picture by pressing the home or menu button of the remote control to select “Customer Support”, “Self Diagnosis”, and “Signal Information”. 13. When checking, if the antenna signal is 4 or less or the SNR value is 20 or less, it is recommended to check the broadcast signal. “Signal Information” is a feature only available on digital broadcast channels. 14. Select “Signal History” to check the history of automatic storage of channels with weak signal strength. A case where an abnormality occurs in the screen or sound quality<br /> 1.When watching using a public antenna, such as an apartment or multi-family house, screen and voice-related abnormalities may occur if the direction of the antenna is reversed or the antenna moves due to rain or wind.<br /> 2. Screen and voice-related abnormalities may occur due to signal attenuation or power abandonment by boosters and distributors used in apartments and general homes.<br /> 3. Incorrect adjustment of equipment in cable cable broadcasters, apartment management offices, etc. may also cause screen and voice problems. <br /> ※ Naver Nanum Gothic font is applied to this video.
