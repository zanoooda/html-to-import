           0)  - UHD TV before 2016 (UHD TV before 2016 supports European DVB-T2) → For UHD TVs before 2016, you need to purchase a UHD kit to watch the broadcast.   ■ UHD broadcasting quality Q &amp; A Q1. It's UHD, but why is the picture quality bad? A1. UHD should be produced with UHD cameras, editors, microphones, and storage devices from the time of production, but so far, UHD contents have not been produced much due to the lack of UHD equipment. Therefore, since most of the contents of the existing FHD are changed to UHD image quality and transmitted, the image quality is not much different from that of the FHD. In addition, there are not many brokerage houses equipped with UHD transmission equipment at broadcasting stations, so the image quality is set low and transmitted to establish a stable reception environment. To see UHD quality, please see content made exclusively for UHD. (There is a UHD-only channel on TV plus ) Q2. Why should I use STB (or UHD KIT) to watch terrestrial UHD? A2. In the case of products before 2016, it was possible to receive DVB-T2, a European method, and around June 2016, ATSC<br /> 3.0 UHD was adopted as a standard method in Korea and the main broadcast of terrestrial UHD began in May 2017. Please purchase STB (or UHD KIT) for products before 2016. Q3. When can I see the right UHD content? A3. In consultation with each other, the government and broadcasting stations were scheduled to conduct 5% of all broadcasts as UHD content in 2017, and plan to gradually increase it to 25% in 2020 and 100% in 2028.
