            Method of action As power efficiency increases worldwide, relay switches are applied among power terminal parts to prevent unnecessary power loss. When the power is turned on, the relay switch contacts and normal power is supplied to the TV. The relay switch connects and generates click noise. Relay switch contact drops when power is turned off and power is cut off before it is supplied to the TV. At this time, the relay switch contact falls and click noise is generated. In other words, click noise is generated when the relay switch is operated during power ON / OFF, which is not a problem with the product, but a specification of the product to prevent unnecessary power loss.
