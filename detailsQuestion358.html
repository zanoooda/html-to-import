            Method of action Automatic channel setting method If you can't remember a specific channel broadcast, you can remember it through automatic channel setting. It is a function that automatically remembers channels after exploring all channels on TV in a way that remembers channels with broadcast signals while exploring all channels on TV, and does not remember channels without broadcast signals. It takes about 3~5 minutes for automatic channel. If a specific broadcasting channel does not appear even after setting up an automatic channel, it is a symptom caused by a weak broadcasting signal, not a product abnormality, so please contact the broadcaster for a broadcast signal check [wired, cable, skylife, IPTV, etc.] [Setting Method] Remote control home → Settings → Menu → Channel / Broadcasting → Automatic Channel Settings [Press remote control home button] Move [Settings] at the bottom left Press [Channel/Broadcast] on the menu Press [Automatic Channel Settings]
