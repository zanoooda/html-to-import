            Method of action Remote control battery replacement description Most of the symptoms that the remote control does not work are caused by the lack of remaining battery capacity of the remote control. The battery of the remote control provided at the time of purchase is naturally discharged in the distribution process, so it is difficult to use it as much as expected, and the remote control battery must be replaced with a new one. For products sold as low-cost bundled products, the usage time is much shorter than that of genuine batteries, so it is recommended to use genuine batteries packaged in pairs. Battery polarity confirmation explanation When replacing the remote control battery, the battery polarity may be wrong and the remote control may not work. You need to connect the battery - pole to an area that protrudes like a battery insertion spring. If the battery + pole is connected to a spring-like protruding area, the remote control does not work. [Battery normal connection (+) polarity] [Battery normal connection (-) polarity] A new pair of battery replacement explanations When replacing the remote control battery, it may occur when using it by replacing the battery used by other products, not by replacing it in pairs. Unlike the old remote control in the past, the remote control of the recently sold model is equipped with smart functions and has high power consumption, so even batteries that operated normally in other products may not operate normally on TV. When replacing the remote control battery, you must replace the pair together. [Remocon battery-like pair] [Remocon battery different pair] [Note] The remote control genuine battery is charged at<br /> 3.2 V and sold, and in the case of the TV remote control, if the battery voltage drops below 2 V, the remote control does not work. Remote controls for products other than TVs operate below 2 V, but in the case of Samsung remote controls, smart functions are applied and operate only under conditions above 2 V, so other products If you replace the battery you used, the remote control will not work if it is less than 2 V, so you must replace the pair together when replacing the remote control battery. Explaining the Causes of Three-wavelength Fluorescent Lamps If the fluorescent light in the home is turned off and the TV remote control is operated, the frequency of the three-wavelength fluorescent light may invade the TV remote control frequency area and cause frequency confusion. The three-wavelength fluorescent lamp uses an electronic safety device exclusively instead of a coiled magnetic stabilizer, and electromagnetic waves generated from the stabilizer may cause frequency interference at the TV remote control receiver, causing symptoms of not receiving the remote control. [Method of Action] As a temporary measure, there are ways to turn off and use fluorescent lights facing the TV, and to replace fluorescent lights with regular fluorescent lights rather than three-wavelength lights. Please contact the nearest lighting company to replace the fluorescent light. In 1997, the National Institute of Technology and Quality standardized the electronic stabilizer KS C8100 for fluorescent lamps, and the electronic stabilizer frequency for fluorescent lamps is stipulated to use bands other than 33 kHz to 40 kHz. <br /> â€» It is caused by the frequency of the three-wavelength fluorescent lamp invading the frequency 38 kHz area of the TV remote control.
