            - You can't use it because you bought an overseas evolution kit for a domestic model. ■ Reasons for non-use Evolution kits are sold in two models: FHD and UHD. 1) Firmware information (Mycom information) is different for overseas and domestic models. → If the firmware information value is different, it may not work abnormally. 2) Domestic and overseas models may not operate abnormally due to different hardware. 3) It is difficult to guide because there is no safety standard test report (compatibility verification) for the product. → According to the service regulations, products produced in each country are recommended to be used only in that country.
