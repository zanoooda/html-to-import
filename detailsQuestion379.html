           The site does not look normal. - The web browser is not compatible with the Java application, so it does not work normally if it is created using the Java application in the site. It doesn't support Active X. , sites that need to install ActiveX before using the site are not supported. - We do not support e-commerce for online product purchases. (Shopping mall payment, etc.) - Because the number of supported fonts is limited, some text may look corrupt. - If the memory capacity allocated to the web browser is exceeded, the page may not be loaded.<br /> 2. I'm trying to watch a video by running a web browser, but it doesn't come out. - For videos that can be played after installing a separate program, there is no storage space where the TV can be installed separately. Cannot play. - In the case of the TV's web browser, up to Flash Player<br /> 10.1 is supported, so content produced in a higher version than that version cannot be played. (The version of the site cannot be checked on TV) - If the memory capacity allocated to the web browser is exceeded, the page may not be loaded. - The web browser does not support the AAC audio codec due to memory limitations. Only MP3 codecs are supported. - Only H.264 + AAC (HW codec) / On2, Sorencon (SW codec) is supported when playing flash videos.<br /> 3. While watching a movie, the web browser window suddenly turns off. Alternatively, the phrase "memory shortage" occurs. - If the memory capacity allocated to the web browser is exceeded, it can be turned off or stopped after the warning appears. For web browsers, use a simple web search.
