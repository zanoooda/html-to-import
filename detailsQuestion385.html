            Method of action Broadcast signal check Symptoms that occur on a specific channel may occur due to abnormalities on the set-top box device or broadcast signals entering the set-top box, not product abnormalities. When watching a broadcast through a set-top box, the TV only acts as a monitor that shows the signal sent from the set-top box on the screen, Symptoms of screen breaking can occur due to weak broadcast signals or set-top box abnormalities, not TV abnormalities. In this case, please contact the broadcaster for a broadcast signal check [wired, cable, skylife, IPTV, etc.]. Reconnect the power cord of the set-top box Screen blinking symptoms may occur while watching due to set-top box malfunction. In this case, disconnect the power cord on the back of the set-top box and reconnect it about 1 minute later before using it. The set-top box starts initial power booting and needs to be checked after normal booting about 1 to 3 minutes later. If symptoms repeat even after reconnecting the power cord, please contact the broadcaster for an inspection of the set-top box [cable, skylife, IPTV, etc.]. Self-diagnosis image quality test confirmation In the case of screen blinking symptoms, you can check the abnormality/nothingness of the product using the image quality test built into the TV. [Menu → Customer Support → Self Diagnosis → Image Quality Test] Press the remote control home button Move [Settings] at the bottom left Menu → Move customer support [Self Diagnosis] Selection Select [Start image quality test] Sample image stored on TV is displayed When the image quality test is conducted, the image is displayed on the screen, If the image comes out normally,  It's not a product problem. Please contact the broadcaster for set-top box abnormalities or broadcasting signal problems and check the broadcasting signal [cable, skylife, IPTV, etc.] Check HDMI cable It is recommended to use a genuine cable when connecting the TV and the set-top box with an HDMI cable. If the certified HDMI cable is not used, communication errors may cause poor image quality while watching. The genuine HDMI cable is printed or imprinted on the cable with Ultral High Speed HDMI, and if there is no corresponding phrase Please replace it with a genuine HDMI cable with an uncertified cable and use it. Check the "Ultral High Speed HDMI" print or imprint on the HDMI cable.
