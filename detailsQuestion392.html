            Please explain how to take action. Answers If you connect to your PC with an HDMI to HDMI cable and you can't hear the sound from the TV product speaker, the default sound output method of your laptop is set to speaker, so you may not hear the sound from the TV speaker. Please change the basic sound output method from control panel → sound → playback item to Realtek HDMI Output rather than speaker and use it.
