       <li class="subAnswerP">
            In the past, analog TVs did not require much time to process data by watching low-definition images, so they could be changed quickly when changing channels, but since broadcasting itself has a lot of data when watching high-definition digital broadcasting, synchronization time of about 1 to 2 seconds is required when changing channels, resulting in symptoms that take a long time to change channels. Please note that this is caused by an increase in data throughput while watching high-definition digital broadcasting, not product failure, and is used as a common symptom of all digital TVs around the world. It may take a long time to change the channel even when using STB (set-top box). If the sudden channel change is delayed, you need to check if the set-top is being updated regardless of the TV. Inquiries need to be made to each set-top carrier.
