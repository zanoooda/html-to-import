            (Compliance with Article 70-2 (1) of the Broadcasting Act) Q &amp; A Q1. Did the sound suddenly turn down? A1. As the standard law for digital television broadcast volume is applied from May 2, it is normal that the sound becomes smaller than before. Q2. Is there any reason to set the volume standard lower than before? A2. Due to inequality caused by competition for sound levels between broadcasting channel users (home shopping, sports, dramas, etc.), there was a difference in volume between channels and programs in the channel, and the inconvenience was up to consumers. In order to solve this inconvenience, genre-specific characteristic channels such as music, movies, and sports are cases where the law has been revised, recognizing that volume management at the production stage is necessary. (<br /> ※ If professional music programs such as classical music and Korean traditional music are provided live, volume standards are not applied) Q3. Is there a standard value for volume level? A3. It is difficult to guide the standard value of the volume level. The standard volume prescribed by the relevant law is -24LKFS, and the tolerance is ±2 dB. .(<br /> ※ LKFS is a standard unit of volume value calculated in consideration of human auditory cognitive characteristics) Q4. But I'd like to check the TV problem. A4. You can check it through the function of self-diagnosis. Menu → Customer Support → Self Diagnosis → Sound quality test Using Constant volume Please check if this comes out.  Alternatively, it can be seen that the volume size that was different for each channel and within the channel is now a uniform volume size. (There are menu differences depending on TV model. Please refer to the user manual ) Testing the sound quality of TV self-diagnosis<br /> 1.Remote control Home button Click<br /> 2. In the lower left-hand corner, Set Please choose.<br /> 3. Customer support on the menu → Device care Selection<br /> 4. Device Care → Self-diagnosis Selection<br /> 5. Sound quality test Please check the sound status by choice. Q5. How can I know that the law has been revised even though consumers have not been notified? A5. It was announced through the following broadcast by broadcasting company. [Publicity text for viewers (TV subtitles)] With the implementation of related laws (Article 70-2 (1) of the Broadcasting Act) to resolve the volume imbalance between broadcasting channels and programs, digital TV broadcasting programs of all broadcasting media (terrestrial waves, cables, satellites, etc.) will be broadcast in compliance with the standard volume from 4 a.m. on May 2, 2016. Viewers, please note that the TV volume may decrease compared to the present.
