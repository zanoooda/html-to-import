           <br /> 1.When you turn the product on and off to watch TV, you can make various sounds such as "Ttaktak," "Ttuk," and "Ttuk."<br /> 2. This can be caused by shrinkage/expansion of plastic parts according to changes in the temperature of the product or ambient temperature. <br /> ※ Screw fastening part, stand, chassis connection part, etc. of the product<br /> 3. This phenomenon is common in products with a lot of heat changes, and it is similar to the sound of a thud as the external temperature drops sharply when the car is turned off in winter, and the sound of a "thud" when water enters a cup containing ice.<br /> 4. If indoor/outdoor temperature changes such as "spring, fall, and winter" are severe during the four seasons, the frequency of occurrence may increase. Especially during quiet or late-night hours, you can feel it louder.<br /> 5. It usually occurs in newly purchased products and the sound can decrease over time. It's not a product problem, so you can use it with confidence.<br /> 6. If there is a lot of noise periodically, please contact Samsung Electronics Service for an inspection. <br /> ※ Not intermittent symptoms If you can hear the thud continuously more than 10 times inside the TV, you can expect it to be a TV circuit board symptom. Please get an accurate diagnosis from a professional engineer for that part.
