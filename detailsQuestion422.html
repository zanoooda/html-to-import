            For other TVs at home, I was able to set the power on/off melody, but I can't find where on earth I can set this model. I want to hear the melody sound, please tell me how to set it. Answers There is no way to set the UN32F6100AF model as a model without melody ON / OFF function. For reference, models with melody function are only supported in models under F5200 among models released in 2013.
