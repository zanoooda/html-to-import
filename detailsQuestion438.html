            I wonder what the HDMI standard of the model is. Answers The UN40HU7000F model you inquired about supports 4K 60P supported by HDMI<br /> 2.0, but when the product is shipped, it is set to HDMI 1.4 version and shipped. However, if you change HDMI to turn on HDMI in HDMI UHD Color in screen mode, it supports 4:4:4 (4K 60P) supported by HDMI<br /> 2.0.  For reference, you need to check whether HDMI<br /> 2.0 of computer product graphics card can be printed through the graphics card company. (There are differences according to graphic specifications )  In addition, TV products are products for watching broadcasts and can be viewed by connecting general computer screens, but high-end graphic work games can cause disconnection.
