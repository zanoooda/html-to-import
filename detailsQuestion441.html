            Please let me know the wall-mounted bracket model, price, and operating range for the model. Range of operation refers to the direction in which you can move up, down, left, and right. Answers Hello. Sir/ma'am. I am the person in charge of Samsung Electronics service cyber center. The TV (UN40C6630) and wall-mounted bracket models you inquired about are (general / slim) WMN4270S, and the price is expected to be 130,000 won (as of June 2014). The operating range of the model is 15 degrees up and down / 20 degrees left and right. For reference, you can buy it at Samsung Digital Plaza. Thank you.
