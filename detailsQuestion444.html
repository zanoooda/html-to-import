            I have a plan to move, but after I move, I'm thinking about putting the TV on the stand.<br /> 1.Which stand fits the UN46ES7100F model? (Mobile, fixed) I would like to compare product features and prices and know where I can buy them.<br /> 2. There are many types of wall-to-wall use, and I want to compare some characteristics and prices and buy them somewhere.<br /> 3. I heard that there is a mobile installation service for Byeokgyeolyi when moving, where can I apply? Answers Customer, I will explain the stand and purchase method available in UN46ES7100F product. Wall-mounted and stand products are not sold at the service center, so you need to check if you can stock and purchase them at the nearest digital plaza. (However, stand products can be purchased from the service center material room if they are not in stock. )<br /> 1.Available stand <br /> ① CY-UMN4667E: SWIVEL (Turning Stand) <br /> ② Floorstand: Moveable Stand<br /> 2. Usable wall mount <br /> ① WMN250M: Mini slim wall mount - angle unadjustable, framed wall mount. <br /> ② WMN4270S: Normal wall mount - 15° up and down, 20° left and right adjustable, wall mount fixed to bracket.<br /> 3. You can apply for the previous installation service at customer center 1588-3366.
