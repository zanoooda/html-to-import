            I think this product purchased in the U.S. is only for 110 V, can I change it to 220 V at a domestic A/S center? Question content UN55F6350AF model is being purchased and used in the United States, so you inquired if it can be used in Korea in the future. LED TV products sold in the United States in 2013 are 110 V-only products according to safety standards, so voltage cannot be changed.
