            Service check Symptoms that the screen appears later than the voice (sound is heard first) can be caused by abnormalities in the video circuit or delayed panel operation. During initial operation, the screen and voice do not match 100%, but it is almost hard to feel, and the symptoms of voice being heard first and the screen coming out late It can be caused by an abnormality in the product. We need to check the service of the product.  In this case, I recommend you to check it through an accurate diagnosis by the engineer.
