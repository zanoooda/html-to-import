            If only a specific file cannot play a video, it may occur because the codec information of the video file is a file that is not used on TV. It can be seen as a symptom caused by the mismatch between file information and TV, not product abnormalities. To check the video file codec, you can install the video encoding program on your PC and check the information of the video file through the encoding program. We cannot provide the program because there is no encoding program operated by Samsung Electronics. Among the free encoding programs, the Daum Pod encoder, which has proven stability and performance, is the most used, and please use it after obtaining sufficient information on how to encode using blogs.  □ Codec (CODEC) type Example of video support codec for KQ75QNA90AFXKR model) Initialization method If the TV is malfunctioning, initialization is required. <br /> ※ [Caution] After initialization, the initial setting must be carried out, so please note the setting value before initialization. 2020 TV Initialization Method<br /> 1.Remote control Home button Please press .<br /> 2.
