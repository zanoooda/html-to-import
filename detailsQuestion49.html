            1) Voltage/frequency In Korea, 220V power is used, and when purchasing overseas products, you must check if 220V power is supported (freebolt). If the voltage is not right, you need to use Dorance (trans). Electrical safety approval standards are not available if they are different from domestic standards. If you ignore these safety standards and use them, they can cause failures or other accidents. In particular, if it is a product for the Americas, you need to use Dorance (trans). □ Domestic Electrical Safety Approval Standard  □ Specifications for approval of electrical safety for overseas America 2) Broadcasting method / modulation method (color method) You can use it only when the broadcasting method is correct to view the screen by connecting TV and AV products. There are three broadcasting methods: NTSC, PAL, and SECAM, and NTSC method is used in Korea. Products purchased overseas must support NTSC to be used in Korea, and if the broadcasting method is not correct, the screen is displayed in black and white, making normal viewing impossible.
