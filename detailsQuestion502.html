            In addition, mobile phones can be charged through TV, and mobile phones can be controlled through TV remote control.    How can I see MHL?  You must have a mobile device and TV that supports MHL, and you can watch it by connecting an MHL-only cable or an MHL dongle (HDTV adapter).    Does Samsung TV support all ports?  When using MHL-only cable, MHL is supported only for HDMI<br /> 3.    What kind of TV model can be supported?  It is a model of LED 7 series or higher and PDP 8 series in 11 years.    What kind of mobile device model can be supported?  Compatibility verification has been completed for the Galaxy S2 model, and for other MHL-supported mobile devices, please contact the device manufacturer.    I am the buyer of the existing 11-year TV 7000. How can I do MHL?  If you download the latest SW from the Samsung website and upgrade it, you can use MHL.    How do I connect to MHL?    1) When using MHL-only cable: See Figure 1 on the right - One side of the MHL cable is connected to the micro USB terminal of the mobile device, and the other side is connected to the HDMI3 of the TV.  2) When using MHL dongle (HDTV adapter): See Figure 2 on the right - After connecting the power of the MHL dongle, one side of the MHL dongle connects to the micro USB terminal of the mobile device and the HDMI terminal of the TV with the HDMI cable.     The screen does not appear when connecting the MHL-only cable.  Our TV supports MHL only for HDMI<br /> 3. Please check the input source. Also, please check if your phone supports MHL.    Where can I get an MHL cable or an MHL dongle (HDTV adapter)?  You can search online with an HDTV adapter or purchase it at Samsung Service Center.    Remote control does not work when using MHL dongle.  When using MHL dongle, operation by remote control is not required. Please contact the manufacturer or use the MHL cable.    KEY supported by TV is not running on mobile device.  The actual execution of the key supported by the TV depends on the mobile device. Please contact the manufacturer of the device.    The application of the mobile device does not work with the TV remote control.  The TV provides only movement and selection functions for application execution of the mobile device. Please contact the application manager or mobile device manufacturer to see if the actual application is executed.    Can I see it as a TV USB input through a micro USB cable?  You can't see it with the USB input of the TV, and please use the MHL cable or MHL dongle (HDTV adapter).    I can't charge it while using it.  Depending on the current consumption of the mobile device, charging may take a long time during use.    Can I charge it in TV stand by state?  Provides MHL charging function in standby state.    What is the resolution you support?  MHL can be supported up to 1920X1080 at 30Hz.    Can't I turn on the TV with my cell phone like Anynet+?  MHL does not support turning on TV with mobile device.    Compared with the cell phone, the picture quality is lower.  If the resolution of the one source is low, the TV screen may look worse than a mobile phone because of its large size. Or, if the image resolution sent from the mobile phone is low, the image quality may look bad. If you send it to 1080, the TV will show it as the cell phone sends it, so please contact the cell phone manufacturer for more information.
