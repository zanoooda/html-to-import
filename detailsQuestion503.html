           Is it possible to record ATV (analog) and external input signal? → Not possible. It can only be recorded on DTV, and when you press the "record" button on ATV, "Timeshift and recording are only supported on digital broadcasting. The phrase " appears and it doesn't work. <br /> 2. I want to record on DTV, but can I record if I can't receive the broadcast normally or can't see it? → "Input signal is weak or not available so recording is not possible. The notice " may appear and not work. <br /> 3. Can I switch to another channel (DTV / ATV) while recording? → Not possible. If you switch to another channel during recording (or reservation recording), "Would you like to end recording and switch channels? [Yes] [No]." Since it is not a 2TUNER method, it is impossible to watch other channels during recording. <br /> 4. Can I record even if I turn off the TV during recording (or reservation recording)? → It is possible. Even if the TV is turned off, recording is stopped, or if the recording completion time is not over, recording continues. However, recording is stopped if the power is cut off, not power OFF (power waiting). <br /> 5. Doesn't the phrase "recording" disappear in the upper left corner during recording? → Yes, the phrase keeps popping up to let you know that it is recording. It also moves little by little to protect the screen. In addition, recording for less than 10 seconds is not carried out during general recording, so "records for less than 10 seconds are not stored. The phrase " appears and the recording cannot be saved.
