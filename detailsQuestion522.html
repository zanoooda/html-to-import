[Setting Method] Menu → Customer Support → Self Diagnosis → Sound Quality Test Remote Control - Menu Customer support Self-diagnosis Sound quality test [2017 Product Setting Method] Menu → Move customer support Select [Self Diagnosis] If symptoms cannot be reproduced, select 'No' Select 'Close' when sound quality test is completed During the sound quality test, the sample sound built into the TV is played, and if the sample sound played is heard neatly without noise, it is a symptom of noise due to broadcasting signal problems, not product problems. In this case, please contact the broadcaster to check the broadcast signal [wired, cable, skylife, IPTV, etc.]. Noise standard Due to various circuits and large currents applied to the TV, noise may be generated as electrical components operate according to changes in screen brightness. The normal specification managed by the product is managed below 30 dB (decibel) and is similar to the noise of fans (breezes) and humidifiers. Please use it safely within the normal specification range managed by the product to the extent that it is quieter or similar to the noise generated by the humidifier. For more information, please refer to the manual.
