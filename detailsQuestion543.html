            ■ Sound quality test method<br /> 1.Press the Home or Menu button on the TV remote control to set → Customer support → Device care → Self-diagnosis → Sound quality test.<br /> 2. If the reproduced sample sound is heard neatly without noise, it is a symptom of noise due to broadcast signal problems, not product problems.<br /> 3. In this case, you should contact the management office or broadcasters such as wired and cable IPTV to check the broadcast signal.<br /> 4. However, if noise occurs in the reproduced sample sound, it is recommended to check the TV. ■ Settop volume control<br /> 1.The set-top volume can be raised or lowered by pressing the +, - buttons on the set-top remote control.<br /> 2. It is recommended to set the set-top volume to medium (50% or more) and adjust the volume of the TV. ■ Check and reconnect HDMI cable<br /> 1.I recommend you to use a genuine cable. If the authenticated HDMI cable is not used, the screen may not be visible or a connection error may occur.<br /> 2. Connect the set-top box and TV to check if external input connection lines such as HDMI are connected normally when watching the broadcast.
