Voice recognition [There may be differences depending on the usage environment ] - Average living noise at home: about 40 dB → optimal recognition - Daily conversation: about 60 dB → difficult to recognize - Listen to music at home: about 85 dB → difficult to recognize - For loud rock bands: about 110 dB → Unrecognizable  During the voice test, the distance should be within 1.5 to 4M from the front of the TV. Try it again.
