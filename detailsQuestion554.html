            ■ Image quality test method<br /> 1.Click the home or menu of the TV remote control to set → Customer support → Device care → Self-diagnosis → Image quality test<br /> 2. Please select the "OK" button on the image quality test screen. The test photo will be displayed soon.<br /> 3. Select "Yes" when the test screen appears normally.<br /> 4. If the diagnosis result is normal, it is likely to be a signal from an external device or a cable abnormality. Please check the external device or the connection status.<br /> 5. If the image quality test screen does not appear normally, select "No". Additional test screen appears.<br /> 6. If you have the same symptoms in the additional sample image, you'd better check the TV. ■ Check and reconnect HDMI cable<br /> 1.I recommend you to use a genuine cable. If the authenticated HDMI cable is not used, the screen may not be visible or a connection error may occur.<br /> 2. Connect the set-top box and the TV to check if the external input connection lines such as HDMI are connected normally when watching the broadcast.
