            The blurring of the screen on the TV may occur when the broadcast signal is abnormal, the content, or the resolution of the set-top box is low. Image quality test method<br /> 1.Click the home or menu of the TV remote control to set → Customer support → Device care → Self-diagnosis → Image quality test<br /> 2. Please select the "OK" button on the image quality test screen. The test photo will be displayed soon.<br /> 3. Select "Yes" when the test screen appears normally.<br /> 4. If the diagnosis result is normal, it is likely to be a signal from an external device or a cable abnormality. Please check the external device or the connection status.<br /> 5. If the image quality test screen does not appear normally, select "No". Additional test screen appears.<br /> 6. If you have the same symptoms in the additional sample image, you'd better check the TV. Set-top resolution setting method<br /> 1.Press the “Home” button on the set-top remote control to enter the set-top menu.<br /> 2. Please select “MY” from the top menu.<br /> 3.

For more information on how to set up, please contact each carrier (settop). If the horizontal line, vertical line, or image quality is poor during the image quality test, it may occur due to internal symptoms of LCD panel or TV.  Please get an accurate diagnosis from a professional engineer for that part.
