           <h1 class="listQuestionTitle">Question content I bought Samsung external SSD MU-PS250B and connected it to Samsung smart TV UN55ES8000 model What should I do if it comes out as an 'unknown device' and can't be recognized? Answers This is a problem that occurs because the TV product in use does not support the eXFAT file system, and the external hard product must be connected to the PC and the file system must be formatted and used in the 'NTFS' method</h1>
       </div>
       <li class="subAnswerP">
            For reference, the 2012 model of the eXFAT file system is not a support specification and can only be recognized in models that can use external hard drives among models released after 2013.
