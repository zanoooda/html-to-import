            HDR application can be seen in detail from very bright scenes to very dark scenes. For example, in dark cave scenes, HDR-applied TVs deliver not only the texture of cave walls but also their shapes and colors realistically. Every single sunshine is clearly shown in the scene where the yacht passes over the sea where the sun is shining. ☞ SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) - Standard degree of brightness difference (DR) between bright and dark parts (FHD application) ☞ HDR(High Dynamic Range) - The degree to which the brightness difference (DR) between the bright and dark parts is expanded to be close to what a person actually sees (UHD application) HDR type ■ HDR+ It automatically provides optimal HDR effect for SDR or HDR images. It is a technology that analyzes the contrast of images in detail and shows images similar to those viewed by human eyes. ■ HDR10 The HDR function of a product that satisfies the maximum brightness of 1,000nit, one of the specs related to brightness established by the UHD Alliance, is specifically called HDR10. ■ HDR10+ If the brightness spec established by the UHA is satisfied, the image itself must be created with HDR10+ as a standard that can obtain premium UHD certification. It is an abbreviation of UHD Alliance and is a coalition formed by TV manufacturing technology companies, Hollywood studios, content distributors, and video technology companies. ▶ The difference between HDR10 and HDR10+ is in metadata. Metadata is data such as color and brightness information contained in content such as videos, games, and TV apps. HDR10 uses static metadata that applies the same color and brightness even if the scene changes. The quality of the image is bound to decrease in very dark or bright scenes, while HDR10+ is applied with dynamic metadata that automatically sets metadata for each scene, providing all scenes with optimized image quality. <br /> ※ Metadata refers to additional image information in the content. This includes color, brightness information used in the HDR image mastering process. ■ Dolby Vision This is the name of the image technology provided by Dolby. Dolby Vision embodies brightness, extended contrast ratio, vivid color, detail, and three-dimensionality through technologies similar to HDR that can express a wide color space.
