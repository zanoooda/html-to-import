            - When the light from the LCD backlight passes through the color filter through the liquid crystal, it passes through the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) parts of the color filter, and the color of the light changes. - It is the same principle that when the flashlight light is shined on the cellophane, the light changes to various colors depending on the color of the cellophane. If there is no color filter, LCD will be expressed only bright and dark like black and white TV. - Most displays use a combination of red (R), green (G), and blue (B), which are the three primary colors of light, for each pixel to express various colors. - In the color filter layer, sub-pixels of R, G, and B are generally placed for each pixel, and these three colors represent more than millions of colors. - Samsung TV products use all model RGB color filters based on LCD and LED products. - RGBW is a specification with more white (W) filters, and among the products released by Samsung, RGBW type color filters were applied only to KN55S9CAF products in the past.
