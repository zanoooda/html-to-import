            If the protective film is not removed, the keystone may not be calibrated or malfunction may occur.  It is a very dust-sensitive product, so it is recommended to use a soft cloth (microfiber, dragon) when wiping the lens part. If you are not using The Freestyle (The Freestyle), please put a lens cap on it and keep it. Q5-1. I can't adjust the automatic keystone. A: If the keystone setting is automatic, it may not be accurately corrected depending on the angle of the product (optimal installation state angle) or projection angle. Optimum installation status Like... SAMSUNG logo Is it supposed to go down, When projecting to the ceiling, install it at 45 degrees or higher from the ceiling direction Please check if it is done. If automatic keystone adjustment is not possible, please manually adjust the screen and use it.
