            Method of action Broadcasting signal check guide If screen disconnection symptoms occur on a specific broadcast channel, it may occur due to weak reception of broadcast signals, not product abnormalities. Unlike analog TVs used in the past, digital TVs appear to be abnormal in products due to symptoms such as screen stop and screen breakage when broadcasting signals are weak, but It is not a problem with the actual product, but a symptom caused by weak reception of the broadcast signal, so please contact the broadcaster for a broadcast signal check [wired, cable, skylife, IPTV, etc.] Signal strength checking method Symptoms of screen blinking while watching can occur due to broadcast signal problems, TV abnormalities, and abnormality of the product can be checked through the digital signal strength function.
