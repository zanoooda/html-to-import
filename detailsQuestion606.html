       <li class="subAnswerP">
             In this case, you should contact the cable broadcaster you are watching for a signal check.  If the sample image is not clear during the image quality test, it may occur due to internal symptoms of LCD panel or TV.  Please get an accurate diagnosis from a professional engineer for that part.
