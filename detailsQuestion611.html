            Method of action Duplicate channel deleting method Digital broadcasting is divided into physical channels transmitted from actual broadcasting stations and virtual channels actually watched in order to watch on the same channel anywhere in the country. When watching a broadcast through a separate broadcaster such as wired broadcasting / cable TV / Skylife, the channels do not overlap, but when watching a broadcast by installing a separate digital broadcasting antenna, the broadcast channels may be received in duplicate and two to three same channels may be caught. For example, if a digital antenna is installed and the metropolitan area receives duplicate broadcasts from Namsan Mountain and Gwanaksan Mountain, symptoms of receiving two MBC channels, 11-1 and 11-1, may occur. If the broadcast channel is duplicated through several relay stations, not the product, the duplicate channel can be deleted and used. Press the home button on the remote control → Channel list → Move the channel to delete → Delete Select the duplicate channel you want to delete by running , delete it in order, and use it. Press the home button of the remote control Move
