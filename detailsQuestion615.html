            Method of action Check reconnection after disconnecting power outlet It is necessary to check the connection status of the wall power outlet. There may be cases where the wall power outlet is not connected or the power is not generated due to a wall outlet abnormality.<br /> 1.Please disconnect the TV power cord from the wall outlet and reconnect it.<br /> 2.

Please change the power switch of the multi-tap to 'on' and use it. Multi-tap power switch “off” state Multi-tap power switch “on” state Multi-tap individual power “off” state Check the connection status of the multi-tap If the power of all products such as TV, set-top box, DVD, and mobile phone charger connected to the multi-tap is not turned on, it may occur more than the multi-tap, and in this case, please replace the multi-tap with a new one and use it. If it is not solved by the method I informed, there is a possibility that it may occur due to TV power circuit or mainboard symptoms.  Please get an accurate diagnosis from a professional engineer for that part.
