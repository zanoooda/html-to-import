           Liquid crystal breakage / breakage may occur due to external impact.<br /> 2. It may be caused by a broadcast signal abnormality. Method of action Self-diagnosis confirmation method If it looks broken without external impact, it may occur due to more than a broadcast signal, not a symptom of exterior damage. In this case, you can check whether the product is abnormal or not through the image quality test function. [Menu → Customer Support → Self Diagnosis → Image Quality Test] [Click remote control home button] [Move left lower setting] [Menu → Move Customer Support] [Self-diagnosis Selection] [Select to start image quality test] [Sample image stored on TV is displayed] During the image quality test, the high-definition image built into the TV is displayed on the screen, and if it does not look broken by the high-definition image and can be seen clearly, , it is a symptom caused by a broadcast signal problem, not a product problem. In this case, please contact the broadcaster (wired, cable, skylife, IPTV, etc.) to check the broadcast signal. If you still can't take action, I recommend you to check it through an accurate diagnosis by the engineer.
