            Method of action Sound quality test confirmation If noise is heard when the volume is adjusted to “0”, the noise generated by the speaker may cause a broadcast signal problem or TV abnormality, and through the sound quality test function You can check if there is any abnormality in the product. [Settings Method] Menu → Customer Support → Self Diagnosis → Sound Quality Test Remote Control - Menu Customer support Self-diagnosis Sound quality test [2017 Product Setting Method] Menu → Move customer support Select [Self Diagnosis] If symptoms cannot be reproduced, select 'No' Select 'Close' when sound quality test is completed During the sound quality test, the sample sound built into the TV is played, and if the sample sound played is heard neatly without noise, it is a symptom of noise due to broadcasting signal problems, not product problems. In this case, please contact the broadcaster to check the broadcast signal [wired, cable, skylife, IPTV, etc.]. If noise is generated in the reproduced sample sound, it can be caused by an abnormality in the speaker or voice circuit and must be checked. Noise standard Due to various circuits and large currents applied to the TV, noise may be generated as electrical components operate according to changes in screen brightness. The normal specifications managed by the product are managed below 30 dB and are similar to the noise of fans (breezes) and humidifiers. Please use it safely within the normal specification range managed by the product to the extent that it is quieter or similar to the noise generated by the humidifier. For more information, please refer to the manual. Noise check Electric spark splashing (high frequency) noise may occur due to abnormalities in the internal circuit of the product, but may also occur due to abnormalities in the multi-tap connected to the product. If you connect to the multi-tap and use it, please connect the TV power cord directly to the wall terminal, not the multi-tap. If noise is louder than the sound heard from the humidifier, it may occur in excess of the normal specifications managed by the product, so you should check it. If it has not been resolved, I recommend you to check it through an accurate diagnosis by the engineer.
