            Method of action Check USB device connection compatibility USB's interface method uses a total of 1.1 /<br /> 2.0 /<br /> 3.0 3 methods. Interface method of USB interface description USB 1.1 Data transmission is slow at 12 Mbps per second and is rarely used now. USB<br /> 2.0 In theory, the maximum transmission capacity is 480 Mbps, but under actual use conditions, it supports an average speed of 30 to 33 Mbps. Power is 5 V 500 mA. USB<br /> 3.0 Theoretically, the maximum transmission capacity is 5 Gbps, but under actual use conditions, it averages 100 to 110 Mbps. Power is 5 V 700 mA. <br /> ※ 20 13 years (F series or less) model USB<br /> 3.0 support Samsung Electronics TV uses USB<br /> 2.0 interface and does not support USB<br /> 3.0. There are two types of USB<br /> 3.0 type memory devices sold on the market. When purchasing USB<br /> 3.0 memory, it is not available for TV when purchasing memory that supports only USB<br /> 3.0, and it can be used with TV when purchasing USB<br /> 2.0 /<br /> 3.0 memory, but the actual speed operates at USB<br /> 2.0. <br /> ※ Whether to support USB<br /> 3.0 for 20 14 years (H series) model  USB3.0 interface has been applied since premium model in 2014. USB3.0 → Supported models are marked (marked) on the USB connection terminal Capacity is compatible with USB memory 32G and USB external HDD 1.5TB. (In theory, there is no limit to capacity, but it is recommended to use it below a proven capacity for compatibility) Initialization method Due to TV malfunction symptoms, it must be initialized under factory shipment conditions. <br /> ※ [Caution] Initialization must be carried out after initialization. <br /> ① ~ 2009 Initialization function is not applied → Remove the power cord for about 1 minute and reconnect. <br /> ② 2010-2011 Press the [End] button in the middle of the remote control for 10 seconds. In the center of the TV screen, “Revert all settings to their first state. ” The message "OK" is displayed and initialization proceeds by selecting [OK]. <br /> ③ 2012 ~ Menu of remote control → Customer support → Self diagnosis → Initialization → Enter password (initial number :0000) → Select “Yes” in factory initial value setting → Initialization is completed. Menu → Customer Support Self-diagnosis reset Initial password 0000 Initialization check Initialization complete. If it has not been resolved, I recommend you to check it through an accurate diagnosis by the engineer.
