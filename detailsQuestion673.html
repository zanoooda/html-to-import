            Method of action Broadcasting program's own characteristics Symptoms of repeated symptoms of voice increase or decrease while watching a specific channel broadcast program may occur depending on the location or location of the broadcast filming site, and symptoms of voice increase or decrease may occur as soon as outdoor filming and narration voice change. This is a symptom caused by different voice levels depending on the filming location, and can be set through the automatic volume adjustment function. If the same symptom occurs even after setting the automatic volume function, please note that it is used as a symptom caused by the characteristics of the broadcasting program itself. Automatic volume off method Usually, when watching the news, when an announcer speaks and connects a reporter at the scene, the voice may suddenly grow. In other words, if the voice starts again after it is cut off while coming out, it may occur if the automatic volume function applied to the TV is set to normal (on). You can change the automatic volume setting from normal (on) to off. [Menu → Sound → Speaker Settings → Automatic Volume → Change to Off]<br /> 1.Menu - Sound<br /> 2. Speaker setting<br /> 3. Automatic volume<br /> 4.

Please refer to it and use it. If there is a change in voice in the sample sound being played, it may occur due to an abnormality in the speaker or voice circuit and you need to check it.
