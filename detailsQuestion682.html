            Method of action Symptoms caused by temperature change The cause of the thud noise is the sound caused by the temperature change of the product. When watching TV, it contracts / expands according to internal temperature change, so the front / rear case assembly part The sound that occurs momentarily at the screw fastening part is not a problem of product failure, but a sound caused by temperature change, so you can use it with confidence. If the thud noise occurs periodically (more than 10 times a day), you should check it out. For more information, please refer to the manual together. Ttuk-tuk-tuk-tuk-tuk- Symptoms caused by malfunction Repeated noise may occur due to high voltage device or main chipset error. If you disconnect and reconnect the power cord for more than a minute, normal action may be possible for malfunction symptoms. Please use it after reconnecting the power cord. If the same symptom occurs even after reconnecting the power cord, you should check it. If it has not been resolved, I recommend you to check it through an accurate diagnosis by the engineer.
