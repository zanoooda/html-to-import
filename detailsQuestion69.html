            Method of action This is a problem that occurs when recording TV broadcasting because the format supported is different from PC. Recorded broadcasts cannot be played or backed up on other TVs or PCs due to copyright protection. For reference, PC is Windows-based OS, so it supports FAT16, FAT32, NTFS format, and TV is Linux-based OS, so it supports XFS format. After all, TV and PC are problems caused by different OSs (However, it does not matter when playing) When playing, it means playing a file already stored on a PC or other external device on a TV. <br /> â€» Note: All previous data will be deleted when formatting (Required backup) This inconvenience can be reduced when dividing partitions into two (read/write), and please contact HDD manufacturers how to divide partitions.
