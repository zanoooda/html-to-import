            Method of action [LED, LCD] The biggest cause of heat on the TV is that the backlight is operated to display the screen, which can cause the TV screen to heat up due to heat generated from the backlight. Depending on the type of product, the backlight application location is different, so the heat generation location varies.<br /> 1.Slim LED product The backlight is located on the edge of the TV, so the middle of the screen is lukewarm, but hot symptoms may occur only on the edge. Heat is circulated in stores or large spaces, so you don't feel much heat generation, but heat generation can be felt more in narrow spaces, enclosed spaces, and general home environments. This is not a problem with the product, but heat generation caused by backlight operation, so please use it with confidence.<br /> 2. General LED and LCD Products The backlight is located throughout the TV screen, so you can feel hot symptoms evenly on the TV screen, and due to the nature of the heat, the upper part can feel hotter than the lower part. This is not a problem with the product, but heat generation caused by backlight operation, so please use it with confidence. [PDP] PDP products are products that create screens based on the principle of gas discharge and have similar characteristics to fluorescent lights and neon signs. In other words, because the screen is made by gas discharge, a high temperature occurs, and just as you felt hot when replacing fluorescent lights, PDP products can feel hot as products that display the screen by discharging the same gas. This is not a problem with the product, but heat generation due to the characteristics of the driving method, so please use it with confidence. If you need further confirmation, we recommend that you check it through an accurate diagnosis by the engineer.
