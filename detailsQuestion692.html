           <br /> 1.If you upgrade after installing the evolution kit, the LAN terminal you previously connected to the TV will not be recognized due to the nature of the product. For this customer, the LAN cable must be connected to the LAN cable adapter.<br /> 2. Wireless is the same as the existing method of use. You need to check “Evolution Kit / Jackpack / One Connect Upgrade Method” first. I installed an evolution kit, but there is no response. A. Please separate the kit and proceed with the installation procedure after firmware of the latest version of ES8000. Is it impossible to use the existing 12-year smart remote control?<br /> 1.Only one of the 13-year smart remote control and 12-year remote control enclosed in the kit can be used. You can also use a 12-year smart remote control. Since the 13-year smart remote control is optimized, we recommend using the 13-year smart remote control.<br /> 2. Not two at the same time. For example, 13 years cannot be used for 12 years pairing, and 12 years cannot be paired for 13 years pairing. After upgrading the Evolution Kit, the wireless keyboard and mouse do not work. A. After installing the Evolution Kit, the product will be initialized, so please pair Bluetooth again. Is voice recognition and motion recognition possible after installing the evolution kit? A. Voice and motion recognition through the camera are all possible. Is it possible to change the STB channel like a 13-year-old product without IR extension cable? A. You can use it by setting up an integrated remote control and setting it as a 12-year IR receiver.
