           <h1 class="listQuestionTitle">Heat-generating cause All LED/LCD/PDP TV products implement display screens using back light or driving elements, and the heat generation temperature varies slightly depending on the operating principle and appearance type  Heat generation cannot be largely recognized in stores or large spaces, and heat is generated equally in narrow spaces or in all products produced around the world</h1>

             Internal management is based on the recommendations of the Medical Association related to thermal burns, so there is no harm to the human body in using the product.     Heat generation by product    Product name  Details      LED  - In the case of edge LEDs, LED BARs are located in certain areas of the top, bottom, left, and right due to their characteristics, so only certain areas can be hotter, and the product is slim and has high thermal conductivity, so it can feel hotter than other product groups. - You can see that the LED BAR, which is a light source, is installed in the hottest part by touching it with your hand.    LCD  - Back light is lamp, so heat is generated overall, and heat is generated most at the top of the front.    PDP  - Since the image is implemented by the gas discharge type plasma, invisible light is generated when the plasma collides, and heat is generated in the pixel in the process of generating visible light by hitting the phosphor.
