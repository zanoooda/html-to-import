            Method of action Check earphone connection When a<br /> 3.5 pie earphone is connected to the TV side / rear earphone terminal, the sound of the TV may not be heard by the earphone when connected to a terminal other than the earphone terminal. Please check if it is normally connected to the TV side / rear earphone terminal and use it. Use<br /> 3.5 pie earphones with three poles Connect to Earphone Terminal Confirm the replacement of other earphones. Even if the earphone is connected to the side/back of the TV, if the sound of the TV is not heard by the earphone, it may occur due to an earphone abnormality or an earphone terminal abnormality of the TV. Please check by replacing it with another earphone with a three-pole<br /> 3.5 pie standard. Check whether it works or not using other earphones If it has not been resolved, I recommend you to check it through an accurate diagnosis by the engineer.
