During the initialization process, you must choose between Home Mode and Store Mode. In other words, the factory shipment condition is neither store mode nor home mode, and after installing the product, you choose between store mode and home mode. If you use it at home, you can select Home Mode and use it. Change menu → system → initial setting → store mode → home mode.
