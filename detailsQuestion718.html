            During recording, you can't watch it because you switch to another channel (DTV / ATV). If you switch to another channel during recording (or reservation recording), you will say, "Would you like to end recording and switch channels? [Yes] [No]." It is not a two-tuner method, so you can't watch other channels during recording.  You can record even if you turn off the TV during recording (or reservation recording). Even if the TV is turned off, recording is stopped, or if the recording completion time is not over, recording continues. However, recording is stopped if the power is cut off, not the power off (power waiting).
