            Home mode is a mode used in ordinary homes in which menu settings are maintained, and store mode is a mode that automatically changes to a clear screen after 30 minutes of power ON / OFF for the best image quality. The reason why the screen is changed to a clear screen when the power is turned on/off or when the channel is changed is a symptom caused by setting it to store mode, and normal viewing is possible when changing to home mode. 2009-2012 products Menu → System or (Settings) → Initial Settings → Change store mode to home mode.
