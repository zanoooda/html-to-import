            Recorded broadcasts cannot be played or backed up on other TVs or PCs due to copyright protection. For reference, PC is Windows-based OS, so it supports FAT16, FAT32, NTFS format, and TV is Linux-based OS, so it supports XFS format. After all, TV and PC are problems caused by different OSs. (However, it does not matter when playing) When playing, it means playing a file already stored on a PC or other external device on a TV. <br /> â€» Note: All previous data will be deleted during formatting.
