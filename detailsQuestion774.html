            Because the processing speed of the video signal and the voice signal is different, there is a slight difference in the speed of the video/voice, and although it is not usually felt, the speed difference may feel sensory depending on some broadcasting programs. It is not a symptom caused by a product abnormality, so please feel free to use it. Speaker delay time setting method When listening to TV voice through the home theater, the video is displayed directly on the TV screen, but since the voice signal is output from the TV through the home theater, some delay time occurs in the process of transmitting the voice from the TV to the home theater. Some of the functions of the TV can be set up by applying a function that can minimize the delay time. [Menu → Sound → SPDIF Settings → Delay Time Adjustment] If the voice is faster than the screen: Please set the delay time adjustment higher. [+] If the voice is slower than the screen: Please set the delay time adjustment lower. [-] Even if the delay time is adjusted, there is a time when voice is transmitted from the TV to the home theater, so symptoms that the screen / voice speed is not correct may occur. This is not a product problem, but a problem caused by the time the voice is transmitted from the TV to the home theater, so please refer to it when using it. Menu - Sound SPDIF Configuration If the voice is faster than the screen, the delay time Please set it high If the voice is slower than the screen, the delay time Please set it low. Explain the cause of set-top box When watching a broadcast through a set-top box, the speed of video/voice may vary slightly depending on the speed of video/voice signal transmission from the set-top box to the TV. It doesn't usually feel big, but some broadcasting programs may feel the speed difference. It is not a symptom caused by a product abnormality, so please feel free to use it.
