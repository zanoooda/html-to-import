            If there is an abnormality in the product, a line is formed in the same position on all channels, but if a line is generated by a broadcast signal, the position where the line is formed varies from channel to channel. In this case, please contact the broadcaster (wired, cable, skylife, IPTV, etc.) to check the broadcast signal. Broadcast signal check confirmation guide When you press the menu button on the remote control, you can check for product abnormalities using the menu window displayed. ☞ If the line appears to be covered by the menu window, it is necessary to check the broadcast signal as a symptom of a line occurring due to a broadcast signal abnormality. In this case, please contact the broadcaster (wired, cable, skylife, IPTV, etc.) to check the broadcast signal. ☞ If the line appears on the menu window as it is, it is a symptom of product abnormality and needs to be checked by the engineer.
