            [Note] This feature is only available in the 19-year TV software version 1303.7 or higher. If there is no HDMI cable test function, please update to the latest version software and use it. If you connect a TV and an external device (set-top box, game console, etc.) with an HDMI cable, it is recommended to use a genuine cable. If the certified HDMI cable is not used, malfunction symptoms may occur due to communication errors. The genuine HDMI cable is printed or imprinted on the cable with Ultral High Speed HDMI, and if there is no corresponding phrase, please replace it with a genuine HDMI cable with an uncertified cable.
