            The cause of color blur due to the viewing angle is that LCD / LED products block light using liquid crystal, and since the liquid crystal itself does not emit light, color blur and darkening symptoms may occur depending on the angle of watching TV. Also, liquid crystals are divided into two types according to their purpose. The PVA panel, which is mainly used for TVs, has an excellent side viewing angle compared to the TN panel, so you can watch it from the side with a similar image quality to the front. However, due to the panel characteristics, it is not 100% the same as watching from the front. The liquid crystal is divided into a PVA panel for TV and a TN panel for monitor. The TN panel, which is mainly used for monitors, has good light transmittance when viewing the front, enabling clear image quality, but the image quality is much lower than the front when watching the top, bottom, left, and right sides. Since it is a panel mainly used for monitors, the front viewing characteristics are good, but the image quality is poor due to the panel characteristics when viewing the side. Due to the characteristics of the side viewing angle, you can feel the symptoms of color blur and darkening when lying down and watching the side, and please refer to this as a symptom caused by the characteristics of the TN panel, not the abnormality of the product.
