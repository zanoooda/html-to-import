             [Nanocitran] A sheet made by adding semiconductor particles (quantum dots) of 2 to 10 nm in the form of a film is called a "nanosheet." Quantum Dots Principle? When the blue LED is passed through the nanosheet, the color that can be seen with the human eye looks different depending on the size of the quantum dot. Using this principle, we can use different particle sizes Quantum dots are distributed in nanosheets to increase red and green color reproducibility. â†’ TV made with this principle is called QDTV or SUHD.
