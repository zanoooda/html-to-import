            Method of action Check the volume adjustment of TV and set-top box If the volume of either the TV or the set-top box is low, the voice may be small or inaudible. In this case, you need to adjust the volume of the TV and set-top box, respectively. When adjusting the TV volume, it is displayed from 0 to 100 on the left / right side of the screen, and when adjusting the volume of the set-top box, it is displayed from 0 to 30 at the top of the screen. Check the volume of the set-top box. Check the TV volume. Self-diagnosis sound quality test confirmation This symptom may occur due to a broadcast signal or TV abnormality, and the sound quality test function can check whether the product is abnormal or not. [Menu → Customer Support → Self Diagnosis → Sound Quality Test] Press the remote control home button Move [Settings] at the bottom left Menu → Customer support → Move self-diagnosis Select [Start sound quality test] During the sound quality test, the sample sound built into the TV is played, and if the voice is heard normally, noise occurs due to the broadcast signal problem, not the product problem. In this case, please contact the broadcaster to check the broadcast signal [wired, cable, skylife, IPTV, etc.]. If the played sample sound voice is not heard, the TV speaker volume should be adjusted to 15 or more, and if it is still the same, initialization should be carried out. Check HDMI cable It is recommended to use a genuine cable when connecting the TV and the set-top box with an HDMI cable. If the authenticated HDMI cable is not used, communication errors may cause voice inaudibility symptoms. The genuine HDMI cable is printed or imprinted on the cable with Ultral High Speed HDMI If you do not have the phrase, please replace it with a genuine HDMI cable with an uncertified cable and use it.
